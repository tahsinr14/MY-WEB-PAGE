      There are many things in the world and beyond that we don't know about.<br />
      And the space, is the mysterious one. The Solar System is a gravitational bound system<br />
      which consists of the <b>Sun</b>, the stars and the objects that orbit around the Sun, <br />
      directly or indirectly.<br />
      While traveling through space, <i>asteroids</i> sometimes collide with each other and break up
      into smaller pieces.<br />
      <i>Comets</i> shed dust as they roam the solar system. These <i>'break ups'</i> result in
      numerous small particles<br />
      and fragments, called <i>meteoroids</i>, which orbit the sun.

      Most of the meteoroids are small and rocky. When one approaches the <i>Earth</i><br />
      at a high speed, it burns up as it goes through Earth's atmosphere. From this, a
      <b><i>meteor</i> </b>or a <b>"shooting star"</b> is born.
      <br />
      <br />

      There are also fireballs which are larger meteoroids and they make very impressive sky
      displays as <br />
      they break into particles and burn up in their passage through Earth's atmosphere.<br />
      Some meteoroids survive passage through Earth's atmosphere and hit the ground. These are
      called <strong>meteorites</strong>.

      <b>Meteoroids</b> are objects in space that range in size from dust grains to small
      <i>asteroids</i>. Imagine them as <i>“space rocks"</i>.<br />
      When a meteoroid survives a trip through the atmosphere and hits the ground, it’s called a

      We all know the famous <b>Halley's Comet</b> which returns to Earth's vicinity about every 75

      Comets are rather small, fragile, uneven shaped bodies and, like asteroids, they are left<br />
      over from the solar system development process. Comets, however, are icy dirtballs that form
      in the outer<br />
      solar system. The icy surface is submerged with dust, stones and particles from space.
    </div>
    <br />
    <br />
    The most distant comets may take more than <b>30 million years</b> to complete one orbit. <br />
    And comets with smaller orbital paths can take <br />
    less than <b>200 years</b> to orbit the sun, making them more anticipated.
    <br />
    <br />
    When comets are far from the sun, they are usually very cold, icy dirtballs. However, when they
    approach the sun,<br />
    their surfaces begin to warm and <i>explosive</i> materials vaporize. These vaporizing gases
    carry
    <br />
    small dust grains with them, which form an atmosphere of gas and dust and can look like a<br />

    bright tail when seen from Earth.

    Comets usually have highly eccentric elliptical orbits, and they have a wide range of orbital
    periods, <br />
    ranging from several years to potentially several millions of years. <br />
    The appearance of a comet is called an apparition. According to astronomer
    <b>Gerard Kuiper</b> in <i>1951</i>, <br />
    there are a disc-like belt of icy bodies exists beyond Neptune.<br />
    These icy objects, occasionally pushed by gravity into orbits bringing them closer to the
    Sun,<br />
    become the so-called short-period comets. There are long-period comets also.<br />
    Most comets travel a safe distance from the Sun―comet <b>Halley</b> comes no closer than
    <i>89 million kilometers (55 million miles)</i>. <br />
    However, some comets, called <strong>sungrazers</strong>, crash straight into the Sun or get so
    close that they break up and evaporate.

      Asteroids are minor planets, especially of the inner Solar System.<br />
      They are rocky pieces left over from the formation of the solar system about
      <u>4.6 billion years</u> ago.<br />
      Most asteroids orbit the sun in a belt between <i>Mars</i> and <i>Jupiter</i>. Scientists
      think there are probably <br />
      millions of asteroids, ranging widely in size from hundreds of kilometers across to less than
      <i>one kilometer</i><br />
      (a little more than one-half mile) wide.

    <h5><u>According to NASA:</u></h5>

    Asteroids are somewhat different from comets and meteoroids. In the case of comets, the
    difference<br />
    is in anatomy: as asteroids are mainly consists of mineral and rock, comets on the other hand
    are primarily consists of dust and ice.<br />
    Moreover, asteroids formed closer to the sun, preventing the development of cometary ice. The
    difference between asteroids and <br />
    meteoroids is mainly of size: meteoroids have a diameter of one meter or less, whereas asteroids
    have a diameter of greater than<br />
    one meter. Also, meteoroids can be composed of either cometary or asteroidal materials.

      The public needs to know more about space science and information.<br />
      It is highly recommended to gather knowledge about these.<br />
      The life on the Earth is not only caged among us and the society,<br />
      it is beyond our imagination; some of which are, we could never think of.<br />
      The whole world and our galaxy is still a mystery to each and everyone of us.<br />
